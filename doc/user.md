# Secondary Platform Goals:

Organisations are switching to in-house systems but this requires proper configuration and maintenance to be secure. Funding bodies are giving money to organisations but no tech resources for their internal systems. Senior management often do not know about the state of security of their tech resources - as long as systems are functional, they are not aware of a problem. Even if they are aware of issues, there is not enough information to determine how best to prioritise resources. 

1. Platform to make systems slightly more secure than default;
2. Platform to provide audit of all systems based on the internal configuration, internal live system operation and externally visible operation of the system;
3. Platform to automatically remedy any failed tests, if possible.

4. Platform requiring minimal pre-requisites: debian on server + java on client.
