# thornsec-builds
These are runnable .jar files for ThornSec.  Invoke them, passing your JSON config as arg[0] (or on builds post-April 2019, this argument is optional).

Think of these as akin to "nightlies" - however they aren't automated builds, but are the actual builds used to configure @privacyint.

Using these, as with anything else, is entirely at your own risk - these executable jar files are provided purely for your convenience.

If they're up here, they'll work to (at least) some extent - however, there may be json configuration options which are not reflected in the documentation in the repos.

No technical support can be assumed by your usage of these builds (although if you email me I will do my best to help!)
