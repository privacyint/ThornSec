Not orgsec. Not infosec. Not opsec. Hopefully just a small thorn in the side of your adversaries.

# Primary Platform Goals

1. help systems and networks be more secure than default;
2. complete operational transparency;
3. facilitate cooperation amongst sysadmins;
4. minimal pre-requisites;
5. avenue for learning with others.

# Next Steps

Explore more of the [rationale](doc/rationale.md) behind ThornSec.

Learn how to use the [system](doc/user.md) to conduct audits and to configure systems automatically.

# Want to contribute?

1. What command should a sysadmin run to check if there is an issue?
2. What should the ouput of that command be if the test is passed or failed?
3. Bonus points: what command should a sysadmin run to resolve the issue?

If you can answer the first 2 questions then get in touch or write the appropriate test for inclusion into the codebase. If you can answer question 3 thats even better!
